# Keep looking, don't Settle

标题这句话出自 Jobs 在斯坦福毕业典礼上的演讲，我觉得在此用作这个时隔多年重启的博客的名字非常合适。

多年以前，在某处看过这个演讲，但那时感触并不深。现在把演讲视频在b站上找出来重看了一遍，才发现 Jobs 对于我的影响是多么巨大。

我想在此挑出演讲中的一些段落，放在这篇文章里，在这个无人问津的角落，用以自勉，时刻提醒自己，要不忘初心。


> I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at that time. But looking back, it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

Jobs从大学退学，一个很重要的原因是因为Reed College昂贵的学费，花掉了他养父母毕生的积蓄。Jobs的养父母都是工人阶级，家境并不富裕。所以Jobs说自己天真的（naivly）选择了里德学院。Jobs选择退学的时候也很惶恐（scary），也许也包含对未来的迷茫。多年以后再回过头看，才知道这是他做过的最棒的决定之一。

谁成想中途辍学创业后来竟成了佳话和硅谷风潮，假如Jobs在一个富裕的中产家庭，父母完全供得起他读完大学，他还会选择辍学吗。

> None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the frist computer with beautiful typography.

这里是说他辍学后去旁听了里德学院的书法课（calligraphy instruction），当时完全想不到这会对他的生活产生什么实质性的帮助。但是十年后，当他设计第一台Mac时，过去这些经历全部浮现了出来，他们把这些全部设计进了Mac里。所以Mac成为了第一台拥有漂亮字体的电脑。

> Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something. Your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it lead you off the well-worn path. And that will make all the difference.

你没办法知道你当下做的事情在未来会产生怎样的连结（connect the dots），只有当你回望时，才能把这些看似无关的经历给联系起来。你没法预见未来，所以你只能选择相信，相信你的胆识、你的宿命，你的生活，你的命运、命运种种。只有相信当下的经历在之后的路途中必定会产生连结，你才有信心和勇气去遵从自己的内心（**follow your heart**），即便她把你指向一条小径、岔路。结果会很不一样。

Jobs的这个理念对我的潜在影响就是，当我做一件事时，不会过多的从功利的角度去考虑这件事能带给我的收益，只要我感兴趣，我就会去做。选择读哪本书是这样，看任何一部电影也是这样，听音乐、弹琴也是这样，做投资时也是这样，学日语时也是这样。作为一个理科生，却对文字非常敏感，喜欢读文学著作，这多少有点不一样。你要说读马尔克斯、读村上春树、读石黑一雄、读菲茨杰拉德对生活对工作有什么实质影响，实在说不上，也许让我成为一个内心更细腻的人，但这又有什么用呢。我就是喜欢，所以我就去读，读的过程中内心有所触动，这就够了。

> I didn't see it then but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.

三十岁的时候被赶出了自己亲手创立的公司，当时Jobs并不知道这对他来说其实是件好事。（苹果的）成功的沉重被成为初心者的轻盈所取代，不再对任何事都感到理所应当。

这里的 **heaviness** 和 **lightness** 让我想到米兰昆德拉的《生命不能承受之轻》。

> I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.

这里Jobs说假如没有在他30岁时被赶出Apple这件事，也就不会有他后来创立Next和Pixar这些事。良药苦口，但（当时的）我需要它。
有时生活会给你当头一棒，不要失去信念。我坚信，让我一直

> Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, and don't settle.
